## Technologies used:

MVVM: Model-View-ViewModel is a design pattern that separates a user interface (view) from business logic (view model) and data (model).

Clean Architecture: Clean Architecture is an approach to designing software systems that prioritize maintainability, testability, and scalability. It emphasizes the separation of concerns and the use of dependencies inversion.

Jetpack Compose: Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs with a declarative programming model. It simplifies the process of building complex UIs and improves the overall development experience.

Unsplash API: The Unsplash API is a free, open-source API that provides high-quality photos and images for use in applications and websites.

Retrofit: Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and provides a convenient way to parse response data.

Coroutines: Coroutines are a way to write asynchronous and non-blocking code in a structured and sequential way. They simplify the process of dealing with concurrency and make it easier to write responsive UIs.

Room: Room is a persistence library for Android that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite. It makes it easier to work with databases and provides compile-time checks for SQL statements.

Dagger-Hilt: Dagger-Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the process of managing dependencies and makes it easier to write modular, testable code.

Pagination: Pagination is a technique for loading data in small, manageable chunks. It improves the performance of applications that work with large data sets and makes it easier to provide a smooth user experience.

Navigation Jetpack: Navigation Jetpack is a component of the Android Jetpack library that provides a simple and consistent way to navigate between different screens and features of an application.

Material 3: Material 3 is a design system for creating modern and intuitive user interfaces. It provides a set of guidelines, tools, and components for building beautiful and responsive UIs.

Flow: Flow is a reactive programming library for Android that provides a streamlined and intuitive way to write asynchronous and reactive code. It simplifies the process of handling data streams and makes it easier to write responsive UIs.

Coil: Coil is an image loading library for Android that provides a fast and lightweight way to load and display images from various sources. It simplifies the process of caching and resizing images and provides a smooth user experience.
